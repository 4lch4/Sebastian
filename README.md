# Sebastian

Sebastian is a CLI utility for a wide variety of tasks. It's primary purpose is to be a tool for things I either do frequently enough to "automate" or things that are done infrequently enough that I'd like something to simplify doing it in the future.

## Name

The name is a reference to the butler from the anime [Black Butler][0]. The butler is a jack of all trades and is always there to help the main character, Ciel Phantomhive, with whatever he needs. As I continue to work on this project, I hope that this tool will eventually fill a similar role for me.
